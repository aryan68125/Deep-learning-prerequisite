### 🤔 What is Multicollinearity?

**Multicollinearity** happens when **two or more independent variables (features)** in your dataset are **highly correlated** — meaning, they carry **redundant or overlapping information**.

> In simple terms:  
> 🔁 If one feature can be predicted (almost) exactly using another feature, you've got multicollinearity.

### 📊 Example

Let’s say you have two features:

| Age (years) | Age in Months |
|-------------|---------------|
| 25          | 300           |
| 30          | 360           |
| 35          | 420           |

Here:
- `Age in Months` = `Age * 12`

These two features are **perfectly collinear**. Including both adds **redundant information**.

### ⚠️ Why is Multicollinearity a Problem?

#### 1. **Unstable Coefficients**
In linear models:
- The model tries to **assign weights** to features.
- If two features provide **the same information**, the model gets **confused** about how to distribute the weights.
- This leads to **very large, unstable, or even flipped coefficients**.

#### 2. **Harder Interpretation**
- Coefficients become **hard to interpret**.
- You can’t tell which feature is actually influencing the outcome.

#### 3. **May Hurt Model Performance**
- Especially in **smaller datasets**, multicollinearity can lead to **overfitting** or **poor generalization**.

### 🔎 How to Detect It?

- **Correlation Matrix**: Check pairwise correlations between features.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: A statistical measure to quantify how much a feature is linearly related to other features.

### ✅ How to Handle It?

- **Drop one of the correlated features**
- **Combine features** (e.g., using PCA)
- **Regularization techniques** (like Lasso or Ridge) that penalize large coefficients
