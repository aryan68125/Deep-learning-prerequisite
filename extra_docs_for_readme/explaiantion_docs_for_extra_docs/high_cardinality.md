ðŸ‘‰ **High-cardinality** simply means:  
> There are **many unique values** (many different categories) in a feature.

---

### Example of **Low Cardinality**:
Suppose you have a feature like **"Gender"**:
- Male
- Female
- Other

â†’ Only **3 unique values** â†’ **Low cardinality**.

---

### Example of **High Cardinality**:
Suppose you have a feature like **"User ID"** or **"Product ID"**:
- 10,000 different users
- 100,000 different products

â†’ **Tens of thousands** of unique values â†’ **High cardinality**.

---

### Why is **high cardinality** important?
- **One-Hot Encoding** becomes **very inefficient** for high-cardinality data.  
  (Imagine a vector of 100,000 zeros with just one "1" â€” huge and sparse!)
- Instead, we use **embeddings**:  
  - We map each unique category to a **small dense vector** (say, 32 or 128 numbers).
  - Much more memory-efficient.
  - Helps the model **learn relationships** between different categories (e.g., similar products have similar embeddings).

### Quick Visualization:
| Category Type       | Examples          | Encoding Type            |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Low Cardinality       | Gender, Color      | One-hot or Label Encoding |
| High Cardinality      | User ID, Word, Product ID | Embedding Layer (Deep Learning) |

---

### Short Answer:
**High-cardinality** = Feature with **many distinct values**.  
**Use embeddings** to handle them efficiently instead of traditional one-hot encoding.
