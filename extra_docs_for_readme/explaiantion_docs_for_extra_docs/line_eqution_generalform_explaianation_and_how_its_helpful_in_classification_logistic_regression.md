## ✅ 1. **How to convert between forms:**

We’re starting with:

### **Slope-intercept form:**
\[
y = mx + b
\]

We want to rewrite it into:

### **General linear form:**
\[
0 = ax + by + c
\]

### ▶️ Rearranging step-by-step:

Start with:
\[
y = mx + b
\]

Bring all terms to one side:
\[
0 = mx - y + b
\]

Now match this to the general form:
\[
0 = ax + by + c
\]

So:
- \( a = m \)
- \( b = -1 \)
- \( c = b \) (the y-intercept)

✅ Done! You've just transformed the slope-intercept form into the general form.

## 🧠 2. **Why this is useful in classification (e.g., logistic regression):**

### 📌 Logistic Regression Hypothesis:

In logistic regression, we model the **probability** that a sample belongs to class 1:

\[
h(x) = \sigma(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b)
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \) is the sigmoid function
- The inside of the sigmoid, \( z = w \cdot x + b \), is a **linear combination** — same as \( ax + by + c \)

### 🔍 Decision Boundary:

To **classify**, we check:
\[
h(x) \geq 0.5 \Rightarrow \text{class 1}
\quad \text{vs} \quad
h(x) < 0.5 \Rightarrow \text{class 0}
\]

Since sigmoid is 0.5 when the input is 0, the boundary is:
\[
w \cdot x + b = 0 \quad \text{⇨ our decision boundary}
\]

This is exactly the **general form**: 
\[
0 = ax + by + c
\]

So the general form directly expresses the **boundary between classes** in logistic regression.

[How is w⋅x+b=0⇨ our decision boundary is equivalent to the general form equation of a line 0=ax+by+c?](how_logistic_regression_equation_is_same_as_a_lines_general_form_formula.md)

### 💡 Summary:

| Form | Example | Use |
|------|--------|------|
| Slope-Intercept | \( y = mx + b \) | Great for simple 2D plotting |
| General Linear | \( 0 = ax + by + c \) | Better for classification, higher dimensions, matrix form, logistic regression, etc. |
