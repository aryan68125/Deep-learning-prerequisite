Let’s break it down with some context and an intuitive explanation.

### 🧠 Context: Binary Category and Model Input

Suppose you have a binary categorical feature like `Has Degree`:

| Has Degree |
|------------|
| Yes        |
| No         |

You might one-hot encode it into two columns:

| HasDegree_Yes | HasDegree_No |
|---------------|--------------|
| 1             | 0            |
| 0             | 1            |

But since these are perfectly inversely correlated (if one is 1, the other is 0), you only need **one** of them.

Let’s keep only `HasDegree_Yes`:

| HasDegree_Yes |
|----------------|
| 1              |
| 0              |

Now here's the key idea 👇

### 📌 What Does “Absorbing the Off Effect into the Bias” Mean?

In a **linear model** (like logistic regression), the prediction is:

```
z = (w * x) + b
```

Where:
- `w` is the weight for the feature
- `x` is the value (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No")
- `b` is the bias (intercept term)

#### So for `HasDegree_Yes`:

- If `x = 1` (Yes):  
  `z = w * 1 + b = w + b`  
- If `x = 0` (No):  
  `z = w * 0 + b = 0 + b = b`

🔥 **This is the “off effect”:**  
When the feature is **off** (`x = 0`), it contributes **nothing**, and the model just uses the **bias term `b`** as the base prediction. So, the **effect of being “No” is already captured by the bias** — we don’t need an explicit column for it.

### 🎯 Why This Is Useful

- **Saves space:** No need for redundant columns
- **Avoids multicollinearity:** Redundant features can hurt model performance
- **Still fully expressive:** The model can still learn the difference between "Yes" and "No"

---

### ✅ Summary

- In binary one-hot encoding, you can drop one column because the model will **absorb the effect of the dropped category into the bias term**.
- When the dropped category is active (`x = 0` for the kept column), the model prediction relies solely on the **bias**, which acts as the baseline.
- This is standard practice in linear models and helps keep the model well-behaved.
