## ðŸ“Œ Why introduce a dummy variable \( x_0 = 1 \)?

### âœ… Vector form:

![Vector representation](../util_pictures_for_explaination_README/explaiantion/vector.png)

This makes the math:
- Shorter
- Cleaner for gradients and matrix operations
- Easier for generalization (works in any dimension)

### ðŸ§  Example:

If your original model is:

![Same thing but easier](../util_pictures_for_explaination_README/explaiantion/same_thing_but_easier.png)

### ðŸ“ˆ Bonus:

- This trick is heavily used in **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, and **neural networks**.
- Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch usually **include the bias as a separate parameter**, but mathematically it's equivalent to this dummy-feature trick.
