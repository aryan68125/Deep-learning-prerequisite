### 🔷 **What You See in the Plot**
In the image:

- There are two clearly **separated clusters**:
  - **Blue Xs** on the upper-left
  - **Black Os (dots)** on the lower-right
- A **blue line** separates them — this is our **decision boundary**.

### 🧮 **Equations of a Line**

#### ✅ Slope-Intercept Form:
\[
y = mx + b
\]
- `m` is the **slope** (tilt of the line)
- `b` is the **y-intercept** (where the line crosses the y-axis)

But this form becomes **inconvenient** in machine learning when you want to handle higher dimensions or rewrite it in a general format.

#### ✅ General Linear Form:
\[
0 = ax + by + c
\]

You can rearrange this into slope-intercept form if needed, but this format is more general-purpose — especially useful in classification (like logistic regression). <br>

### 📐 **So Why 0 = x - y?**

This means:

\[
0 = x - y \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y
\]

That’s a line at **45°** (i.e., angle between x-axis and the line is 45°), passing through the origin (0, 0).

### ⚙️ In Terms of Parameters:

Given:
- `a = 1`
- `b = -1`
- `c = 0`

Plugging into:
\[
0 = ax + by + c
\Rightarrow 0 = 1 \cdot x - 1 \cdot y + 0 \Rightarrow x - y = 0
\]

✅ This line **perfectly separates** the two classes in your diagram:
- Points **above** the line (where `x < y`) are mostly "X"s
- Points **below** the line (where `x > y`) are mostly "O"s

---

### 🚀 Why This Matters in ML:
In **binary classification**, linear models (like logistic regression or a single-layer neural net) try to find such a **linear boundary** (like `x - y = 0`) that best separates the two classes.

In higher dimensions, it's not a line but a **hyperplane**:
\[
w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b = 0
\]
