### ðŸ¤” So Why Don't We Need Two Columns for a Binary Category?

Letâ€™s say we have a binary category like:

| Gender |
|--------|
| Male   |
| Female |

If we do **One-Hot Encoding**, we get:

| Male | Female |
|------|--------|
| 1    | 0      |
| 0    | 1      |

But here's the thing:

> **The two columns are perfectly correlated** (if one is 1, the other is 0), so one column is actually **redundant**.

### âœ… Why We Only Need One Column

You can **represent this binary information with a single column**:

| Gender (encoded) |
|------------------|
| 1 (Male)         |
| 0 (Female)       |

This is often called **Label Encoding** for binary categories.

#### Why it works:
- Logistic regression and neural networks can handle numerical inputs.
- The model will learn the relationship between `0` and `1` with respect to the output.
- Itâ€™s **more efficient** (less memory and faster computation).
- No information is lost because the second value is **completely determined** by the first.

### ðŸ”¥ Bonus: When Would You Still Use Two Columns?

You **might** use two columns (one-hot) if:
- Youâ€™re using a model that canâ€™t assume linear relationships, like some tree-based models (although they handle label encoding just fine too).
- You want to keep a consistent preprocessing pipeline across categorical variables of all sizes.

---

### ðŸš€ Summary

- Binary categories donâ€™t need two one-hot columns because one column already contains all the needed information.
- Using one column is simpler and avoids redundancy.
- The model will still learn the correct relationships with a single encoded value.
